BukkitUI
========

BukkitUI is a user interface replacement for the Bukkit console.
It makes life as a server owner much easier, as it requires you to press a few buttons, until you have a running server!
BukkitUI is written in Java, and is designed to be cross-platform, so Linux users (like me) have as much a chance at running a Bukkit server as Windoze users.
